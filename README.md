# Prime-Number-Finder-Assembly-8051
This program finds if an input number (N) is a prime number or not by using Assembly 8051 programming language.

## Contributions
Please contribute to my repository if you can find an efficient algorithm for closest square root finder for non-perfect square values of N since this version uses a manual option for that specific line of the code.
